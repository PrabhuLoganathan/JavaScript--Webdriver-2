Selenium Webdriver Javascript Await
By Robert Bourbonnais

Shows how to create Selenium tests using Javascript
and makes use of await and async functions to handle javascript promises 
in a more natural way.

It contains three Selenium test files in .js and matching files in .java
Note: If you know how to write Selenium test in java, you can use the matching files as a Rosetta stone.

It will allow you to compare and contrast the classic 
Webdriver + Java + Maven typology

with the newer
Webdriver + Javascript + Mocha typology

Note: Both solutions need to have Chromedriver and Firefoxdriver (Gecko) in the path

In order to run the Javascript version, you will need to have Node, NPM, and Mocha installed globally.
